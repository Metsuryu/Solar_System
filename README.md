# Solar_System
Here it is:
http://solsys.co.nf/

I'm currently remaking it in Phaser.js from the old version that was pure Canvas.

A small Solar system with Sun, Earth and Moon, and Mars, animated with Phaser.js.

#TODOs for now:

- Make site look nicer

- Add additional informations

- Add additional informations for other planets

- Maybe make them clickable

- Change the speed of the rotation and revolution of planets.

- Add the other planets, and celestial objects.
