# Solar_System
Here it is:
http://solsys.co.nf/

A small Solar system with Sun, Earth, and Moon, animated with Javascript.
You can change the speed of the rotation and revolution of the Earth. 
It also keeps track of the number of rotations and revolutions.

I may add the other planets in the future.

#TODOs for now:

- Fix CSS and center canvas

- Maybe remake it with p5js or some other framework

- Make the moon cast a shadow on earth

- Make site look nicer

- Add additional informations

- Add other planets

- Add additional informations for other planets

- Maybe make them clickable
